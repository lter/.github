## About this GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was built to house GitHub repositories that span more than one site as well as provide a home for the scripted workflows created by the synthesis working groups that the LTER Network Office funds. Our new Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR) course materials also live in this organization.
