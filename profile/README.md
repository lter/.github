## About this GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was built to house GitHub repositories that span more than one site as well as provide a home for the scripted workflows created by the synthesis working groups funded by the LTER Network Office. Related repositories share specific GitHub "topics" and--usually--share a prefix to the repository name. You can find a more in-depth index of repositories in the [organization index repository](https://github.com/lter/lter_github-index#readme).
