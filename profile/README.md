## About this GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was built to house GitHub repositories that span more than one site as well as provide a home for the scripted workflows created by the synthesis working groups that the LTER Network Office funds. Some educational materials are hosted here as well like the Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR) course and an ESA (2024) short course primer on synthesis science in ecology. The Information Manager community also hosts several repositories in this Organization.

### Repository Names

Any repository beginning with `lter-sparc-` was created for one of the SPARC (Scientific Peers Advancing Research Collaborations) synthesis working groups funded by the LNO. Similarly, all repositories beginning with `lterwg-` are created for the 'full' synthesis working groups (funded for 2 years of meetings rather than 1 in the case of SPARC groups).

### GitHub "Topics"

We also make extensive use of GitHub's "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)" to make repositories in this organization more easily-findable by thematic group.  To find repositories in a given topic type the name of the topic you want to find into GitHub's search interface. If you're making a new repository please try to use existing topics before making new ones! Current topics include (in alphabetical order):

`climhydro` | `documentation` | `education` | `eml-metadata` | `lter-imc` | `lter-science` | `lter-site-specific` | `scientific-computing` | `sparc-group` | `synthesis-working-group`

There is also an `inactive` topic that we recommend adding to repositories without activity in the last 5 years (or so).
