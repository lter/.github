## About this GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was built to house GitHub repositories that span more than one site as well as provide a home for the scripted workflows created by the synthesis working groups funded by the LTER Network Office. Related repositories generally share a name prefix (e.g., `lterwg-...` are working group repositories, `ssecr-` are related to the [SSECR course](https://lter.github.io/ssecr/), etc.) but you can find a more in-depth index of repositories in the [organization index repository](https://github.com/lter/lter_github-index#readme).

### GitHub "Topics"

We make extensive use of GitHub's "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)" to make repositories in this organization more easily-findable by thematic group.  To find repositories in a given topic type the name of the topic you want to find into GitHub's search interface. If you're making a new repository please try to use existing topics before making new ones! Current topics include (in alphabetical order):

`climhydro` | `documentation` | `education` | `eml-metadata` | `lter-imc` | `lter-science` | `lter-site-specific` | `scientific-computing` | `sparc-group` | `synthesis-working-group`

There is also an `inactive` topic that we recommend adding to repositories without activity in the last 5 years (or so).
