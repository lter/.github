## About this GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was built to house GitHub repositories that span more than one site as well as provide a home for the scripted workflows created by the synthesis working groups that the LTER Network Office funds. Some educational materials are hosted here as well like the Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR) course and an ESA (2024) short course primer on synthesis science in ecology. The Information Manager community also hosts several repositories in this Organization.

Any repository beginning with `lter-sparc-` was created for one of the SPARC (Scientific Peers Advancing Research Collaborations) synthesis working groups funded by the LNO. Similarly, all repositories beginning with `lterwg-` are created for the 'full' synthesis working groups (funded for 2 years of meetings rather than 1 in the case of SPARC groups).
